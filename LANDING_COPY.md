## Who we're building for

**Lina** — *The quiet victory*
> She reorganized the library's entire local history section while volunteering — months of quiet work no one asked for. She made a badge for herself, because *she* knew it mattered.

**Eva** — *The big map*
> In a manic surge, she planned a massive urban farm. Then crashed. Two years later, the platform showed her: the compost thread was always the strongest. That piece became real.

**Marcus** — *The marathon song*
> His concept album scattered into chaos across dozens of half-finished tracks. His mentor saw what he couldn't: "You already have an EP. Tracks 3, 7, 9, and 11." He finished it.

<small>*These are composite stories based on neurodivergent experiences that shaped our design.*</small>

## What we're building

A different kind of achievement tracker. You create badges for the things you accomplish — big or small, formal or personal. You decide what counts.

Progress at your pace. Come back whenever you're ready. And everything you create? Yours — to keep, to share, to use however you choose.

Built on [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org) — an open standard that means your credentials are portable, verifiable, and truly yours.

## Where we are

Early. Honest. Making progress.

The [core tools](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/monorepo) are built and published. The platform that ties it all together is next.

Want to follow along? We build in public on [GitHub](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev).

## Design Notes

**Unifying theme:** Progress without permission-seeking

**Emotional hooks (for different visitors):**
1. "I did this, even if no one else sees it" — private self-recognition
2. "Unfinished doesn't mean worthless" — preserving work through chaos
3. "The finished slices have their own beauty" — reframing success
4. "A trusted voice cutting through noise" — human mentorship
5. "Your learning counts without a diploma" — alternative credentialing

**Tone:** Welcoming, direct, neurodivergent-friendly, celebrates progress over perfection
