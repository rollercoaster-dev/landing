# Visual Mood Board — Rollercoaster.dev

*Research compiled: 2025-12-30*

**Goal:** Dark, daring, artsy. "Weirdos first." But approachable, not alienating.

## What We Learned

### The Problem with "Design Studio" Sites
Sites like eloyb.design, mbrown.work, stefanvitasovic.dev are technically impressive but feel like portfolios flexing. They say "look at my skills" instead of "we understand you."

**Key insight:** Simple palettes, complex interactions — not the reverse.

### What Actually Works
- **Two colors max** (eloyb uses only black + lime green)
- **Chaos in the interaction/reveal**, not in static visual noise
- **Typography IS the design** when done with confidence
- **Restraint + personality** beats loudness

## Reference Sites (For Technique, Not Vibe)

| Site | What to Learn | Link |
|------|---------------|------|
| **eloyb.design** | Two-color palette, ASCII art, scrambling text hover | [eloyb.design](https://eloyb.design) |
| **mbrown.work** | Theme system, chaotic REVEAL animations, drag-to-reveal | [mbrown.work](https://mbrown.work) |
| **brunotome.dev** | Text-first, personality through language, anti-decorative | [brunotome.dev](https://brunotome.dev) |
| **Rainbow Unicorn** | Personality-driven, conversational, dark + playful | [rainbow-unicorn.com](https://rainbow-unicorn.com) |

## Directions We Explored

### Neo-Brutalist / Glitch
Raw, intentionally imperfect, embraces digital "errors"
- **Verdict:** Good for energy, but can feel cold or try-hard

### Dark Collage / Zine
DIY aesthetic, layered textures, punk energy
- **Verdict:** Interesting but can feel messy, hard to read

### Hand-Drawn / Naive
Human touch, imperfect lines, warmth
- **Verdict:** Good for approachability, but can feel too soft

### Immersive / Interactive
Scroll-driven storytelling, depth, experience-centric
- **Verdict:** Right approach, but needs to serve emotion not show off

## What We Actually Landed On

**The page IS the rollercoaster.** Not a style — an emotional journey.

### The Emotional Arc
1. **UP:** Brutalist energy, big fonts, white space, momentum
2. **DOWN:** Dark, tired fonts, purple accents, the fog
3. **DISORIENTATION:** Off-kilter, tilted, fragments floating
4. **RELIEF:** Warm cream, settled, calm, exhale

### Color Palette (v4)
```
White (#f8f8f8)     → Energy, brutalist
Black (#0c0c0c)     → Depth, the down
Purple (#9d8cff)    → Accent through dark sections
Purple-muted (#2d2640) → Disorientation background
Warm cream (#e8dfd0) → Relief, landing
```

### Typography
- **Space Grotesk** — Bold, uppercase, brutal energy
- **Crimson Pro** — Italic, light, tired/human/relief

## Neurodivergent Design Principles

From research on inclusive design:

- **Soft, muted colors** over bright/harsh (reduces sensory overload)
- **Plenty of white space** (cluttered interfaces overwhelm)
- **Consistent navigation** (predictable layouts help)
- **Plain language** (avoid idioms, abstract metaphors)
- **User control** (no autoplay, no scroll-jacking)
- **Flexibility** (allow customization where possible)

Our approach respects these while still having personality.
